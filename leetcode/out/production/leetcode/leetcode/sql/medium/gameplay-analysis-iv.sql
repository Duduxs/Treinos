Create table If Not Exists Activity (player_id int, device_id int, event_date date, games_played int)
Truncate table Activity
insert into Activity (player_id, device_id, event_date, games_played) values ('1', '2', '2016-03-01', '5')
insert into Activity (player_id, device_id, event_date, games_played) values ('1', '2', '2016-03-02', '6')
insert into Activity (player_id, device_id, event_date, games_played) values ('2', '3', '2017-06-25', '1')
insert into Activity (player_id, device_id, event_date, games_played) values ('3', '1', '2016-03-02', '0')
insert into Activity (player_id, device_id, event_date, games_played) values ('3', '4', '2018-07-03', '5')

-- First Solution

SELECT round(count(a.player_id) /(select count(distinct player_id) from Activity a3),2) as fraction from Activity a
where (a.player_id, date_sub(a.event_date, interval 1 day)) in (select a2.player_id, min(a2.event_date) from Activity a2 group by a2.player_id);
